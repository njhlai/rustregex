## About
rustregex is a toy regex parser written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with no other dependencies beyond the Rust Standard Library [std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/).

## Requirements
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Recommended to use Rust through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

- The implementation of parsers as monadic parsers is based on [this blog post](https://kean.blog/post/regex-parser) by Alex Grebenyuk.
